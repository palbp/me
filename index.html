            <p>Graduated from <a href="https://www.isel.pt/en" target="_blank">ISEL</a> and holding a Master's degree from 
                <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">IST</a>, I have been working in the industry since 1997 
                when I became a member of <a href="https://cc.isel.pt/" target="_blank">CCISEL</a> and began my professional career in the 
                field of software engineering and programming. Since then, I have been consistently involved in activities 
                within the industry, both through ISEL and by directly joining the teams of the companies I have collaborated 
                with. In this context, I have been part of teams responsible for delivering software used by millions of users, joined technical leadership 
                teams responsible for designing solutions, promoting best practices, and providing technical guidance. I have 
                also been responsible for defining the strategic aspects related to the production and maintenance of software 
                solutions, particularly in specifying the work methodologies and the production, delivery, and maintenance 
                procedures for the developed software. My activity in the industry has, therefore, been comprehensive, leading 
                to the award of the title of Specialist by <a href="https://www.ipl.pt/en" target="_blank">IPL</a> in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an Associate Professor at ISEL and responsible for the course <a href="https://github.com/isel-leic-pdm" target="_blank">Mobile Devices Programming</a> 
                offered in <a href="https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/computer-science-and-computer-engineering" target="_blank">LEIC</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/informatics-networks-and-telecommunications-engineering" target="_blank">LEIRT</a> programs. 
                I teach topics related to programming languages, software design, virtual execution systems, concurrent programming, distributed applications, 
                web applications, and their supporting infrastructures. Throughout my tenure as a professor, I have supervised and evaluated dozens of final 
                projects for undergraduate and master's degrees in my field and made decisive contributions to ensure the alignment of LEIC curriculum with the
                industry's needs.
